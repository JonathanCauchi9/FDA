Functional Data Analysis Outputs and Figures
This repository contains the R scipts and resulting outputs for an application of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) on two different datasets, namley: Global Radiation Dataset & Hedge Fund Returns Dataset. All figures and code are produced using RStudio.

1. Structure

For each dataset, three approaches are used:

Unweighted approach

AR(1)-weighted approach

Custom-weighted approach (or name your second weighted method if it has a specific name)

This results in six total scripts, organized as follows:

/radiation
    ├── unweighted_radiation.R
    ├── weighted1_radiation.R
    └── weighted2_radiation.R

/hedge_funds
    ├── unweighted_hedgefunds.R
    ├── weighted1_hedgefunds.R
    └── weighted2_hedgefunds.R

2. Figures
All figures can be found in this repository in the folders: /figures_radiation and /figures_hedgefunds.

3. Data
Radiation dataset: A download link will be provided soon.

Hedge fund dataset: Uploaded in this repository as an RDA file. Refer to /insert folder path. 

4. Notes
The figures and code presented in this repository form part of the empirical work conducted for my dissertation, entitled “Volatility and Performance: Do Hedge Fund Indices with Higher Volatility Offer Better Risk-Adjusted Returns?”. The full dissertation, which includes the theoretical background, methodology, and interpretation of the results, can be accessed at the following link: [Insert Dissertation Link Here].
