# **Functional Data Analysis: Outputs and Figures**

This repository contains the **R scripts** and resulting **outputs** for an application of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) conducted on two distinct datasets:

- **Global Radiation Dataset**  
- **Hedge Fund Returns Dataset**

All code and figures were produced using **RStudio**.

---

## **1. Structure of the Repository**

For each dataset, the following three smoothing approaches are applied:

- **Unweighted approach**  
- **AR(1)-weighted approach**  
- **Custom-weighted approach** (please update with the method’s name if applicable)

This results in a total of **six R scripts**, organized as follows:

/radiation ├── unweighted_radiation.R ├── weighted1_radiation.R └── weighted2_radiation.R

/hedge_funds ├── unweighted_hedgefunds.R ├── weighted1_hedgefunds.R └── weighted2_hedgefunds.R


## **2. Figures**

All graphical outputs from the analysis are available in the following folders:

- `/figures_radiation` – for plots generated from the radiation dataset  
- `/figures_hedgefunds` – for plots generated from the hedge fund dataset

These will be updated progressively as the work is finalized.

## **3. Data**

- **Radiation Dataset**: A public download link will be provided shortly.  
- **Hedge Fund Dataset**: Included in this repository as an `.RDA` file. Refer to the following path:  
  `/data/hedge_fund_returns.RDA`

## **4. Dissertation Reference**

The figures and code presented in this repository form part of the empirical work conducted for my dissertation, entitled:

> **“Volatility and Performance: Do Hedge Fund Indices with Higher Volatility Offer Better Risk-Adjusted Returns?”**
