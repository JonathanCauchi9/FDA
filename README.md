This repository houses all code and data pipelines for:

> **Investigating Different Weighting Approaches for Functional Principal Components Analysis**  
> Jonathan Cauchi, May 2025

We apply **Functional Data Analysis (FDA)**—with a focus on **Functional PCA (FPCA)**—to two real-world time series:

1. **Radiation levels** at Dutch KNMI weather stations  
2. **Daily closing prices** of assets in a hedge-fund portfolio  

Four weighting schemes are compared:

- Unweighted  
- Auto-Regressive (AR)  
- Rolling-variance  
- GARCH-based  

We demonstrate how each affects smoothing, eigencomponent estimation, and FPCA results.
